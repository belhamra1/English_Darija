Forced Downshifting 
0004618
Figure 3-25
The forced downshifting function is operated by the

When the transmission is set to either the second forward 
(F2) or second reverse (R2) position, pressing the KD button downshifts the transmissi on to first forward (F1) or 
first reverse (R1).
The combined use of the KD button function and the 
direction downshifting function makes shifting operation much easier during bucket loading operation.NOTES:
•  As an example, with the loader approaching the 
material pile in F2 (second forward) speed, pressing the KD button downshifts the transmission to F1.
•With the bucket fully load ed and the control in F2, 
moving the transmission control lever down to the R position changes the transmission to the R2 speed automatically.
•This allows the loader to reverse at R2 speed and 
improve operational efficiency.

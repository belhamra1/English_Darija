WARNING
Before proceeding with any battery maintenance 
procedure, follow and remember these points:
  • Battery gases are explosive. Never smoke 
around batteries or expose them to sparks or open flames.
  • Wear personal protecti ve equipment (PPE) when 
working with batteries.
  • Work in a well-ventilated area.  • If battery acid contacts skin or eyes, flush the 
area immediately with fresh water and seek medical attention.
  • When disconnecting a battery, wait for at least 2 
minutes after engine shutdown before disconnecting the battery so the engine control module (ECM) can complete its shutdown procedure.
Failure to observe and follow this caution could 
result in serious injury or death.
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
NOTES:
•  There are two 12V batteries connected in series to 
provide 24V to the electrical system.
•Allow several minutes for any accumulated battery 
gases to clear before servicing the batteries.
2. Unlock and open the battery compartment at the left 
rear of the machine and verify that the battery disconnect switch is in the OFF position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.

the ribs. Lack of tension, misalignment, worn pulleys, or a combination of these are factors.
•Uneven rib wear:  Serpentine belt shows damage to 
the side with the possibility of breaks in the tensile 
cord or jagged-edged ribs. A thumping/grinding noise may also be heard when running.
•Improper installation:  The serpentine belt ribs may 
begin to separate, causing the belt to unravel.
•Cracking: Small cracks develop along the length of 
a serpentine belt rib or ribs. With continuous exposure to high temperatures, the stress of bending around the pulley leads to cracking.
•Misalignment: Sidewalls of the belt may appear 
glazed, or the edge-cord may become frayed. A noticeable noise may result.
•Gravel penetration: Small pinholes are visible on 
the back side of the belt . Bumps may be visible, and 
fabric around the holes can be frayed, indicating damage from foreign objects such as dirt, gravel, or similar debris.

cord or jagged-edged ribs. A thumping/grinding noise may also be heard when running.
•Improper installation: The serpentine belt ribs may 
begin to separate, causing the belt to unravel.
•Cracking: Small cracks develop along the length of 
a serpentine belt rib or ribs. With continuous exposure to high temperatures, the stress of bending around the pulley leads to cracking.
•Misalignment: Sidewalls of the belt may appear 
glazed, or the edge-cord may become frayed. A noticeable noise may result.
•Gravel penetration: Small pinholes are visible on 
the back side of the belt. Bumps may be visible and fabric around the holes can be frayed, indicating damage from foreign objects such as dirt, gravel, or similar debris.
Replace the belt if damaged.

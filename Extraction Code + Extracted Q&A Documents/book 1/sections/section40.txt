MAINTENANCE
5-47 SW405K Wheel Loader OMMNOTE: The oil level should be level with the bottom of the 
fill/check plug hole.
7. Add oil as necessary. See “Industrial Gear 
Oil/Temperature Data” on page 5-7.
8. Install the fill/check plug.
Change the Front and Rear Axle Oil
NOTE: Change the drive axle oil after the initial 14 days 
or 100 hours of service, then every 6 months or 
1000 hours thereafter.
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to the OFF 
position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
3. Chock the wheels.
WARNING
  • Risk of high pressure injection of oil through 
skin.
  • Residual pressure in the brake system may 
cause oil to be released under high pressure, even if the engine has stopped running for a period of time.
  • Before performing any type of service on the 
brake system, make sure to relieve the brake hydraulic pressure.
Failure to follow this warning can result in serious 
injury.

4. Press and release the brake pedal 30 to 40 times to 
relieve the pressure in the brake accumulator.
NOTE: For axle oil capacities, see “Location, Capacity, 
and Type” on page 5-6.5. Place an appropriately sized container under the 
drain plug (2) on the bottom of the axle, then remove the drain plug and the fill/check plug (1).
NOTE: Inspect the drained oil for signs of metal particles 
and foreign material. If any abnormality is found, collect an axle oil sample and send out for testing. See “Collect Front and Rear  Axle Oil Samples” on 
page 5-51.
NOTICE!
Dispose of the used oil in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Failure to do so could damage the environment.
6. Install the drain plug when all of the oil has drained.
7. Add gear oil as needed th rough the fill/check plug (2) 
hole until it reaches the bo ttom edge of the fill/check 
plug hole.
Replace the Brake Line Filter 
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.

5. The brake line filter is inside the machine frame on 
the left side near the fr ame articulation joint. 
NOTICE!
Dispose of hydraulic oil and filters in accordance 
with all applicable en vironmental regulations.
Failure to follow this notice could damage the 
environment.
6. Place an appropriately sized container under the 
brake line filter housing (2) to catch any oil that may leak out.
7. Remove the brake line filter housing.8. Remove the brake line filter element (3) from the 
brake line filter head (1).
9. Clean the inside of the brake line filter housing.10. Install a new brake line filt er element onto the filter 
head.
11. Install and tighten the brake line filter housing.12. Turn the battery disconnect switch to ON.13. Start the engine.14. Run the engine for 10 minutes.15. Shut down the engine and check for leaks.16. Check the hydraulic oil level. “Check the Hydraulic 
Oil Level” on page 5-35.
Check the Transmission and Engine 
Mounting Fasteners
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Check for loose, worn, or damaged transmission and 
engine mounting fasteners.
NOTE: Contact a SANY dealer if service is required.Check the Transmission Oil Level
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Chock the wheels.3. Warm the transmission oil to operating temperature.
0004905Figure 5-107
NOTE: Transmission oil level should be checked with 
the engine running at idle (600 rpm) at 
180°F–200°F (82°C–93°C).
4. Remove the dipstick (1) fr om the transmission filler 
tube (2).
0000924Figure 5-108
5. Check the transmission oil level on the dipstick. The 
level must be between the high (3) and low (4) marks.
NOTICE!
Do not overfill with tran smission oil so the oil 
level is above the high mark on the dipstick. This could result in transmission damage and improper machine operation.
6. Shut down the engine and add transmission oil as 
needed through the filler tube. See “Location, 
Capacity, and Type” on page 5-6.

SW405K Wheel Loader OMMRecommended Lubricants, Fuel, 
and Engine Coolant 
Always use SANY-approved lubricants, coolants, and 
filters. SANY is not responsible for damage caused by using unauthorized lubricants and coolants.NOTICE!
Never mix fluids of different brands or viscosities (weights) and never overfill the system you are servicing. Failure to follow these standards can damage the machine or cause it to operate improperly.
Location, Capacity, and Type 
Fuel
WARNING
  • Fuel or fuel vapors that  come into contact with 
hot surfaces or electrical components can cause a fire.
  • Never service the fuel system near an open flame 
or while smoking. Clean up spilled fuel immediately.
Failure to follow these wa rnings could result in 
death or serious injury.
Deutz
® recommends the use of No. 2 ultra-low sulfur 
diesel (ULSD) fuel for all no rmal operations. Use of No. 1 
diesel fuel in a blend with No. 2 diesel fuel is permitted in cold weather environments when temperatures are below 32°F (0°C).NOTES:
•  Deutz® does not recommend the use of any diesel 
fuel with a cetane level less than 40.
•Do not use gasoline, kerosene, or any unapproved 
fuels in the fuel system.
•If fuel waxing or bacteria should occur in the fuel 
system, have the fuel system professionally serviced.
Make sure that there is no water or any foreign material 
in the fuel.
Take appropriate precautions to prevent fuel 
contamination during refueling.
NOTICE!
Never dilute fuels. Damage to the injection system can result, which causes the machine to operate improperly.

NOTE: Due to its comparatively better lubric ating characteristics (including improv ed engine oil consumption, engine 
operation in frigid climat es, and continued lubricatio n in high temperatures), SAE 5W-40 is recommended for 
a majority of climates. In some ci rcumstances, short-term use of low-viscosity engine oil in temperatures 
below 23°F (-5°C) is acceptable. However, long-term use can reduce engine life. 
Grease Type Summer Winter

Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)
SANY recommends using diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) that 
meets ISO 22241-1.
Engine Coolant
Engine coolants used can be any brand meeting the Deutz
® classification TR 0199-99-1115/5 EN.
Grease
Always use clean EP (extreme  pressure) grease when 
greasing the machine. Avoid us ing low-viscosity greases. 
Use greases designed for:
• Heavy-duty bearings and gene ral industrial lubrication.
• Heavy-duty plain and ro lling element bearings 
operating under severe conditions, including shock loading in wet environments.
Windshield Washer Fluid
Only use clean automotive windshield washer fluid. Do not mix concentrates into th e washer fluid. In cold 
weather areas, use washer fluid with a low temperature rating.Oil TypeTemperature °F (°C)

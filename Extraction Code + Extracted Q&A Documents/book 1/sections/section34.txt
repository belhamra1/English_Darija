SW405K Wheel Loader OMMNOTICE!
Use low-pressure compressed air and do not 
point the nozzle directly at the radiator fins to avoid damaging the fins or causing other engine damage.
7. Start the engine and blow or  wash dirt and debris out 
of the cooler fins using low-pressure air or water.

8. Allow the engine to run until the air flowing out of the 
intake air cooler (10), air conditioner condenser (11), hydraulic oil cooler (12), transmission oil cooler (13), and the coolant radiator (14) is clear of dust or debris.
9. Shut down the engine and blow remaining dirt or 
debris away using low-pressure air.
NOTE: The machine automatically returns the fan 
direction to clockwise once the engine is shut off.Fuel System
Fill the Fuel Tank
WARNING
  • Fuel or fuel vapors that come into contact with 
hot surfaces or electrical components can cause a fire.
  • Never service the fuel system near an open flame 
or while smoking. Clean up spilled fuel immediately.
  • Do not top off when filling the fuel tank.
Failure to follow these warnings could result in 
death or serious injury.
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to the OFF 
position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.

NOTE: Cover the fuel tank filler tube whenever the cap is 
removed to prevent dirt and debris from entering the fuel tank.
NOTE: For the fuel tank capacity, see “Location, Capacity, 
and Type” on page 5-6.
3. Unlock and remove the fuel  tank filler cap (1) from 
the fuel tank filler tube on  the right rear of the

MAINTENANCE
5-23 SW405K Wheel Loader OMM4. Inspect the vent hole (2) in  the filler cap. Pressure in 
the fuel tank may drop if the vent hole in the cap is blocked. This may hinder the flow of fuel. Clean the vent as needed.
5. Inspect the O-ring seal (3) in  the fuel filler cap. Debris 
could damage the seal and prevent it from functioning correctly. Replace the seal as needed.
6. Add fuel as needed.7. Install and lock the fuel ta nk filler cap after refueling.
Drain the Primary Fuel Filter/Water 
Separator
WARNING
Never maintain the fuel  system near an open 
flame or while smoking. Failure to follow this warning could result in death or serious injury.

4. Locate the primary fuel filter (1).5. Place an appropriately sized container under the 
primary fuel filter/water separator.
6. Open the drain valve (2) to drain water.7. Close the drain valve.
NOTICE!
Dispose of contaminated fuel in compliance with 
all applicable environmental regulations. Failure to do so could damage the environment.
NOTE: SANY recommends fully draining and refilling the 
fuel tank if an excessive amount of water or contaminants is found while draining the 
fuel/water separator
Replace the Primary and Secondary Fuel 
Filters 
WARNING
Never maintain the fuel system near an open 
flame or while smoking. Failure to follow this rule will result in deat h or serious injury.

4. Disconnect the water sensor wiring harness 
connector (1).
5. Place an appropriately sized container under the 
primary fuel filter/water separator.
6. Open the drain valve (2).7. Turn the primary fuel filter/water separator 
counterclockwise to remove.
NOTICE!
Dispose of contaminated fuel in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Failure to do so could damage the environment.
8. Apply a thin film of clean engine oil to the O-ring on 
the new primary fuel filter/water separator.

11. Remove the dipstick (3) from the transmission filler 
tube (4).
12. Add the appropriate amount of transmission oil 
through the filler tube. See “Location, Capacity, and 
Type” on page 5-6.
NOTICE!
Do not overfill with tran smission oil so the oil 
level is above the high mark on the dipstick. This could result in transmission damage and improper machine operation.

13. Run the engine at 500–600 rpm until the 
transmission temperature reaches 180°F–200°F (82°C–90°C). See “Transmission Information Screens” on page 3-33.
14. Check the transmission oil level on the dipstick. The 
level must be between the high (5) and low (6) marks.
15. Adjust transmission oil as needed.
Collect Oil Samples
1. Obtain an oil analysis sample kit from a SANY dealer.2. Operate the machine unt il the lubricant in the 
compartment being tested is up to normal operating temperature.
CAUTION
To make sure of the validity of the oil sample, it is critical that all the material used to collect the sample are absolutely clean.  Failure to follow this 
caution can cause equipment damage and contaminate the sample.
3. Send the samples for testing in accordance with the 
instructions packaged with the sample kit.
Collect Engine Oil Sample
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to OFF. See 
“Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
3. Open the left side engine compartment access 
doors. See “Engine Compartment Access Doors” on page 3-6.

Collect Hydraulic Oil Sample
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to the OFF 
position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
3. Relieve the hydraulic system pressure. See “Relieve

NOTE: The hydraulic tank  filler cover may move up while 
the fasteners are loosened due to the action of an internal spring.
5. Slowly remove the fasteners (6) while pressing down 
on the hydraulic ta nk filler cover (5).
NOTICE!
Block the filler opening whenever the cover is 
removed to prevent dirt and debris from entering the hydraulic tank.

Apply grease to the fittings on the driveshaft, articulating 
joint, and the work equipment according to the lubrication chart on the machine.
NOTICE!
Always use clean EP (extreme pressure) grease when lubricating the machine. Avoid using 
low-viscosity greases. SANY recommends greases designed for:
  • Heavy-duty bearings and general lubrication.
  • Heavy-duty plain and rolling element bearings 
operating under severe conditions, including shock loading in wet environments.1) Bucket cylinder grease fitting – base end 9) Lift cylinder grease fitting – base end (both sides)
2) Steering cylinders grease fitting – rod end (both sides) 10) Center link-to-link arm grease fitting3) Steering cylinders grease fitting – base end 11) Boom-to-bucket grease fitting

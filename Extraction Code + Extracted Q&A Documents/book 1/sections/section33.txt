1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to the OFF 
position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on 
page 3-8.
3. Open the left side engine compartment access

WARNING
Engine coolant is toxic. Avoid inhaling or ingesting engine coolant. If eyes or skin are contaminated by engine coolant, wash the affected area with plenty of water and seek medical treatment immediately.
Do not remove the expansi on tank filler cap while 
the engine is hot. Engine coolant may be under pressure when the engine is hot. Avoid contact with hot engine coolant. Allow the engine to cool 
before removing the radiator cap.
Failure to follow these warnings could result in 
death or serious injury.
5. On top of the machine, ope n the expansion tank filler 
cap door (3). If additional engine coolant is required, slowly open the expansion tank filler cap (2) to 
release any pressure from the expansion tank.
6. Add coolant through the ex pansion tank filler, then 
install the expansion tank filler cap. See “Engine Coolant” on page 5-8 for recommended coolant.
7. Start and run the engine at low idle until it reaches 
normal operating temperature.
8. Shut down the engine, allow it to cool, then repeat 
these steps as needed.

7. Place an appropriately sized container under the 
radiator drain hose (2). For radiator capacity, see “Location, Capacity, and Type” on page 5-6.
8. Open the radiator drain valve (3).9. Allow the engine coolant to completely drain into the 
container.
NOTICE!
Dispose of engine coolant in accordance with all applicable environmental regulations. Failure to follow this notice could damage the environment.
10. Close the radiator drain valve after the cooling 
system is empty.
11. Add new engine coolant directly into the expansion 
tank filler neck until the coolant level reaches the 
bottom of the filler neck.
12. Start the engine and run it at low idle for about 
5 minutes to allow the engine coolant to circulate.

NOTE: The engine must be shut down to perform this 
procedure.
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Open the radiator and oil cooler access door. See 
“Radiator and Oil Cooler Access Door” on page 3-7.
WARNING
  • Compressed air can cause serious injury or 
death. Do not allow compressed air to come into contact with skin. Always wear goggles, gloves, and other personal prot ective equipment (PPE).
  • Compressed air can damage the cooling fins if 
the nozzle is too close to the fins. To prevent cooling fin damage, keep the nozzle a safe distance away while cleaning.
  • Never direct compressed air directly into the 
cooling fins. Damaged cooling fins may lead to coolant leaks and engine overheating. In dusty environments, inspect th e cooling fins daily 
regardless of the maintenance schedule.
Failure to follow these warnings could result in 
serious injury or da mage to the machine.

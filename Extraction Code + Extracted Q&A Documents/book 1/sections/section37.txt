Check the Hydraulic Oil Level
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to OFF. See 
“Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
0005089Figure 5-72
1. Check the hydraulic oil level in the sight glass (1) on 
the left side of the machine behind the cab.
2. The sight glass has high (2) and low (3) level marks.
NOTICE!
Do not add hydraulic oil to a level above the high 
level mark on the hydraulic tank sight glass. This could result in machine damage and improper machine operation.
NOTE: Add hydraulic oil if the o il level is below the low 
mark on the hydraulic tank sight glass.
Add Hydraulic Oil
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Turn the battery disconnect switch to OFF. See 
“Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
3. Relieve the hydraulic system pressure. See “Relieve 
Hydraulic System Pressure” on page 5-36.0002515Figure 5-73
4. Remove four fasteners (1) and the access panel (2).
0002714Figure 5-74
NOTE: The hydraulic tank  filler cover may move up while 
the fasteners are loosened due to the action of an internal spring.
5. Slowly remove the fasteners (4) while pressing on 
the hydraulic tank filler cover (3).
6. Remove the hydraulic  tank filler cover.

8. Add hydraulic oil until the level is between the high 
and low level marks on the hydraulic tank sight glass (6). See “Check the Hydraulic Oil Level” on 
page 5-35.
9. Install the hydraulic tank filler cover and access 
panel.
10. Turn the battery disconnect switch to the ON 
position. See “Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
11. Start the engine.12. Run the engine for 10 minutes.13. Shut down the engine and check for leaks.14. Recheck the hydraulic oil level.Check Hydraulic Connections
1. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
2. Lower the work equipment to the ground.3. Turn the battery disconnect switch to OFF. See 
“Battery Disconnect Switch” on page 3-8.
NOTE: Replace hoses if cracked, damaged, or worn.
4. Inspect all hydraulic hoses and tubes for cracks, 
damage, or abnormal wear.
5. Check fittings at both ends of all flexible hoses.6. Inspect all fitting locations and replace any damaged 
or defective fittings.
NOTE: The fasteners at each end of these hoses may 
loosen occasionally due to vibration. Do not use thread sealant when tightening loose fittings and installing new fittings.
7. Tighten any loose fasteners.
Relieve Hydraulic System Pressure
WARNING
  • Allow the hydraulic system to cool before 
servicing. Hot oil may cause burns or other serious injury.
  • The hydraulic tank may be under pressure, and 
hydraulic oil may be present at the filler cap. Relieve pressure to prevent injury.
Failure to follow these warnings could result in 
death or serious injury.
1. Park the machine on a level surface and lower all 
equipment to the ground.
2. Shut down the engine.3. Prepare the machine for service. See “Maintenance 
Safety” on page 2-5.
4. Turn the key switch to ON.5. Fully cycle all hydraulic controls two to three times 
within 15 seconds to release pressure remaining in the hydraulic system.
6. Turn the key switch to OFF.

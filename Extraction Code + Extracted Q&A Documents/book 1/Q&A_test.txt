Q: What should you check the engine serpentine belt for?
A: •Abrasion:  The serpentine belt appears shiny, glazed, or fabric is exposed.  This is a sign that the serpentine belt is in contact with an object such as a flange or fastener.
•Chunk-out:  Chunks of rubber material have broken off from the serpentine belt. At this stage, the serpentine belt can fail at any moment. Heat, age, and stress are the primary contributors.
•Pulling:  Serpentine belt material is sheared off from the ribs. Lack of tension, misalignment, worn pulleys, or a combination of these are factors.
•Uneven rib wear:  Serpentine belt shows damage to the side with the possibility of breaks in the tensile cord or jagged-edged ribs. A thumping/grinding noise may also be heard when running.
•Improper installation:  The serpentine belt ribs may begin to separate, causing the belt to unravel.
•Cracking: Small cracks develop along the length of a serpentine belt rib or ribs. With continuous exposure to high temperatures, the stress of bending around the pulley leads to cracking.
•Misalignment: Sidewalls of the belt may appear glazed, or the edge-cord may become frayed. A noticeable noise may result.
•Gravel penetration: Small pinholes are visible on the back side of the belt. Bumps may be visible, and fabric around the holes can be frayed, indicating damage from foreign objects such as dirt, gravel, or similar debris.
